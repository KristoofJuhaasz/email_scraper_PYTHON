# scrapers_PYTHON
Scraping scripts in python environment. The purpose of the first code was to scrape fifa world cup player statistics, and later this dataset was utilized in a self-made world cup result prediction model in 2018 (well, I did not get rich from this... :D). The second code is a simple email address look up code which could be utilized for variouses puposes in the future.
